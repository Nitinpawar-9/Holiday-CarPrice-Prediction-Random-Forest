Holiday Package Prediction & Used Car Price Estimation with Random Forest

Developed a Holiday Package Prediction model using Random Forest Classification on a Kaggle dataset to classify customer interest based on demographic and behavioral features.

Built a Used Car Price Prediction model by scraping data from the CarDekho website and applying Random Forest Regression to estimate car prices accurately.

Performed end-to-end data processing, including web scraping (BeautifulSoup/requests), feature engineering, encoding, scaling, and model evaluation (accuracy, RÂ² score).

Compared model performance with baseline approaches and improved results through hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV.
